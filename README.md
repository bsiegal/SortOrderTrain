Sort Order Train
==================================================

This is a sort order game for kids created with [KineticJS](http://www.kineticjs.com/).  It can be played using any HTML5 browser, including on an iPad.  [KineticJS](http://www.kineticjs.com/) is so fast that there is no discernible difference in use between the iPad and a computer browser.  This project has simple examples of drawing pre-defined and custom shapes, fills using color, gradient or pattern, scaling, handling mouse, touch and drag events, using and moving groups around a layer and to and from different layers for optimal performance, and animation.

How to play
--------------------------------------
* Drag and drop the train box cars to one of the target outlines.
* When you have placed them in ascending sort order, the train will start!
